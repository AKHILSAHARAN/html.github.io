            <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
            <p style="padding: 16px; line-height:1cm;">Linux® is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.
                Think about an OS like a car engine. An engine can run on its own, but it becomes a functional car when it’s connected with a transmission, axles, and wheels. Without the engine running properly, the rest of the car won’t work.</p><br>

               <h2 style="background-color: greenyellow;">Who created Linux</h2>
               <img src="https://cdn.guru99.com/images/LinuxTrovald.png"/>
               <p>Linux is an operating system or a kernel which germinated as an idea in the mind of young and bright Linus Torvalds when he was a computer science student. He used to work on the UNIX OS (proprietary software) and thought that it needed improvements.
                However, when his suggestions were rejected by the designers of UNIX, he thought of launching an OS which will be receptive to changes, modifications suggested by its users.</p>
               <h2 style="background-color: greenyellow;">Linux and open source</h2>
                <p>Linux is a free, open source operating system, released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Anyone can run, study, modify, and redistribute the source code, or even sell copies of their modified code, as long as they do so under the same license.
                    Linux has become the largest open sources software project in the world. Professional and hobbyist programmers from around the world contribute to the Linux kernel, adding features, finding and fixing bugs and security flaws, and providing new ideas—all while sharing their contributions back to the community.</p>
